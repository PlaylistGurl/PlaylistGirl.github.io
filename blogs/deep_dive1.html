  <h1>Lyrics up for discussion:</h1>

  <pre>
(Let me speak to your manager)
Oh, you mean Benji?
He's fucking busy
'Cause I just drove through AP
On my brand-new jet ski
So leave some tears after the [*bleep*]

If you're feeling silly
I'll call you, beep you later
If Otto doesn't serial kill me
(Otto, I'm sorry, stop)

I'm out of my cage, and I'm on the stage
I'm dying to give you a show
I'm alienated, way overrated
Here are a few of the notes:

My fans are the best
They'd love me more dead
But man, I can't die 'til I finish the album
'Cause if I could time it right, shit could go Platinum
But baby, it's getting too loud

And everyone's freaking me out
I wake up and I'm up and I'm down (Up, up, up)
Yo, shut the fuck out of your mouth
Bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth
It freaks me out

(Otto, where are you going?)
(Otto, get in the car, get back in the car)

I'm Miss Congeniality
Everybody's proud of me
But when they try and tell me
Volume's muted like they're sound asleep

Therapy's not working
I don't understand, so
I kill time playing tennis
With your favorite band. We're singing

(One more fucking time)

And everyone's freaking me out
I wake up and I'm up and I'm down (Up, up, up)
Yo, shut the fuck out of your mouth
Bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth
It freaks me out, it freaks me out

(Where the fuck are you going?)

It gets real super dark around the edge of my heart
(Around the edge of my heart)
It gets real fucking dark around the edge of my heart
(Around the edge of my heart)

Go

Gets real super dark around the edge of my heart
(Around the edge of my heart)
It gets real fucking dark around the edge of my heart
(Around the edge of my heart)

(Otto, don't be mad at this)
(Woo, yeah! Otto! Otto!)
(Oh, man, you don't look so good)

  <p>The opening lines are playful, almost sarcastic. Awsten immediately sets a trap. It's bright, flashy, absurdly confident, but beneath all the glittery nonsense about jet skis and managers (hi, Benji), there's a current of dread. He's laughing at fame even as it suffocates him. It‚Äôs a carnival ride of iron: fun at first glance, nauseating when you linger.</p>

  <p>The meta-commentary about Otto is both hilarious and subtly alarming. Otto isn't just comedic relief; he's Awsten's tether to reality, grounding the chaos. It's a wink to fans, breaking the fourth wall, and yet there's genuine anxiety woven through the humor. ‚ÄúOtto, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù is playful but real, Awsten is painfully aware of the stress his chaotic self places on those closest to him.</p>

  <p>The lyric, <em>"I'm out of my cage, and I'm on the stage, I'm dying to give you a show,"</em> twists the recognizable reference from The Killers into something darker. It‚Äôs no longer liberation, it‚Äôs desperation. He‚Äôs not metaphorically "dying"... he's genuinely sacrificing pieces of himself just to entertain. It's a brutal reminder that our entertainment often comes at the artist's expense.</p>

  <p><em>"I'm alienated, way overrated, here are a few of the notes,"</em> hits like a double gut-punch. It's brilliant: "notes" aren't just musical; they're mental, emotional scribbles too, capturing the chaotic clutter in his mind. He‚Äôs tired of being misunderstood, worn thin by superficial praise, and desperate to be heard authentically.</p>

  <p><em>"My fans are the best, they'd love me more dead"</em>... this lyric hurts because it‚Äôs raw truth. In our celebrity culture, death elevates artists from talented to legendary overnight. Awsten exposes the twisted irony where artists are most appreciated only after tragedy. The painful sarcasm, he can't "die until the album's done," hoping for that perfectly timed platinum success, is a sharp jab at industry vultures circling tragedy.</p>

  <p>The anxious refrain, <em>"everyone's freaking me out...bite tongue 'til there's blood in my mouth,"</em> vividly captures the exhausting cycle of emotional turmoil and suppression. It‚Äôs the silent scream of anxiety, of self-censorship, the relentless battle between authenticity and public expectation.</p>

  <p>Then there's <em>"I'm Miss Congeniality, everybody's proud of me"</em>... the forced smile, the hollow applause. Awsten acknowledges the external approval but admits he's emotionally numb (like the waterparks song)...volume muted, praise meaningless. He's drowning quietly, smiling as he sinks. This is also clever use of the movie reference of feeling like you're not good enough, even though you're putting on a hell of a show.</p>

  <p>Finally, the repeated <em>"it gets real super dark around the edge of my heart"</em> is a confession. Beneath the jokes, beneath the sparkle, there's a shadow creeping inward, darkness at the fringes, threatening to swallow the core. It‚Äôs raw vulnerability, admitting the emotional toll of living on the edge of his own intensity.</p>

  <p>Awsten‚Äôs lyrics are so much deeper than surface-level sarcasm or clever wordplay. They‚Äôre raw emotional snapshots, poetic and brutally honest, wrapped in humor to make the truth a bit more palatable. He's not just writing music, he's bleeding truths and hoping someone notices. And fuck, do we notice.</p>

  <p>If you like my take on this, please feel free to comment below. I'll probably be doing these more often. I find the lyricism fascinating as we unpack all the layers.</p>

  <p>To music we hear, music we see, and music we feel,</p>

  <p><em>P.S. Later this weekend, I'll be posting more about this song and its musical cohesion. &lt;3</em></p>
